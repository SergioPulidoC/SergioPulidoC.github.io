		<strong>Launch Tour</strong> is a direct ticket to an adventure around the world, where you can perfect the projection of your launches and control the trajectory of the ball swinging your phone to avoid obstacles or intelligently use power ups before you run out of power to reach the finish line.
		You have the possibility to play in two modes: <br></br>
		<strong>Endless Mode: </strong>Demonstrate your skills by maneuvering through the air and travel as many meters as you can to rank alongside the best players<br></br>
		<strong>Story Mode: </strong>Reach the goal ring in each level by moving strategically in the shortest time possible along the field and collecting bonus rings. You can achieve perfection in your score!

									<p>As is the case of many games that implement daily quests, challenges and online purchases, <strong>Launch Tour</strong> requires quick access to the current time. However, relying on the OS time isn't a possibility as players could change their device's date and time to manipulate in-game mechanics. By using server time, a reliable solution to obtaining global time is available.</p>

									<div class="collapsible-content bullet-points">
										<li>The NTP Pool Project was used to fulfil this requirement. An array of 44 bytes is received, which is then interpreted to obtain the current time.</li>
										<li>By using this strategy, we prevent users from manipulating or altering the device's time to gain unfair advantages in the game.</li>
										<li>By communicating with a secure server, the game accurately synchronizes system time, ensuring a fair gaming experience for all users.</li>
										<li>Time accuracy is guaranteed by analysing the received Unix time from four different servers.</li>

				<p>MiniTravesía posed a significant challenge in terms of UI/UX design. Unlike most mobile games, which typically require minimal setup, our game's core feature revolved around facial expressions, necessitating a calibration phase for players.</p>
				<button class="collapsible-button toggle-button" onclick="toggleBulletPoints(this)">Details</button>
				<div class="collapsible-content bullet-points">
					<div class="h3">User Interface (UI)</div>
					<p>Enhancing the game's user interface was pivotal for a seamless player experience:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Streamlined Calibration:</strong> Initially, a ~3-minute calibration process was implemented for first-time players. However, player engagement was a priority, leading to a shorter, more efficient calibration phase.</li>
						<li><strong>UI Element Refactoring:</strong> To facilitate the player's interaction with facial expression calibration, several UI elements were repositioned and refined.</li>
						<li><strong>Interruptible Calibration:</strong> The calibration process was transformed into a series of brief, interruptible steps, each taking no longer than 20 seconds to complete.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="h3">User Experience (UX)</div>
					<p>The player's experience was at the forefront of our development efforts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Optimized Calibration:</strong> Accommodating a more straightforward calibration process required a sophisticated backend calibration algorithm, ensuring the accuracy of facial expression detection.</li>
						<li><strong>Rapid Calibration:</strong> The calibration phase was refined to take less than 20 seconds to complete, and calibration data was stored for subsequent playthroughs, eliminating the need for repeat calibrations.</li>
						<li><strong>Flexible Calibration:</strong> Players were granted the flexibility to redo specific calibration phases in any preferred order, enhancing customization and usability.</li>
