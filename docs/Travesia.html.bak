					<li><strong>Facial Landmarks Detection:</strong> Employed OpenCV for Unity for facial landmarks detection, enabling the detection of key facial points, such as eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
					<li><strong>Custom Face Analysis:</strong> Developed a custom library to analyze detected faces, determining their relative position, rotation, and orientation within the game environment.</li>
					<li><strong>Blink Detection:</strong> Created a proprietary blink detection algorithm inspired by Otsu's algorithm. This algorithm monitored eyelid activity over a period, computed histograms, and determined the point with maximum inter-group variance, effectively detecting blinks.</li>

										<button class="collapsible-button toggle-button" onclick="toggleBulletPoints(this)">More info</button>
										<div class="collapsible-content bullet-points">
											<li>For the heart of our procedural world-building, I engineered an in-house Depth-first Search (DFS) algorithm. This technique harnessed the power of graph theory, enabling exhaustive exploration of each branching path before skillfully backtracking.</li>
											<li>To ensure a seamless gaming experience, my DFS implementation leveraged Unity's coroutine system. This innovative approach allowed for the generation of an array of paths within a single frame, maintaining a fluid frame rate of at least 30 FPS.</li>
											<li>The algorithm provided flexibility with manual adjustment options, allowing for a virtually infinite range of maze configurations by specifying the number of rows and columns.</li>
											<li>Once the maze structure was in place, we applied a touch of randomness. Randomly selected prefabs were strategically placed within the maze, enhancing its natural appearance and seamless integration with the game's environment.</li>
											<li>As part of this system, a maze-solving algorithm was thoughtfully designed. Not only did it serve the purpose of debugging, but it also introduced an auditory element, dynamically tailoring the game's difficulty and offering players the perfect challenge.</li>
