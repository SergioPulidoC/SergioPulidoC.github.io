				<strong>Aprendiendo con Emma</strong> invites you to embark on an enriching journey within the realm of <strong>educational gaming</strong>. This unique Windows-based game was meticulously crafted as part of an innovative project during my master's degree in electronic engineering.<br><br>

				Tailored for the special needs of children with <strong>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</strong>, Aprendiendo con Emma serves as an empathetic companion in the world of <strong>emotional intelligence</strong>. Our goal is to foster a deeper understanding and expression of complex emotions.<br><br>

				Step into the virtual world with <strong>Emma</strong>, your virtual guide, as she demystifies the intricate language of emotions. Throughout the game, you'll embark on a journey that involves detecting emotions in various situations, expressing emotions yourself (with guidance and feedback), and learning to connect emotions with their corresponding facial expressions.<br><br>

				Aprendiendo con Emma is more than a game; it's a powerful tool designed to <strong>nurture emotional growth</strong> in children with ASD, providing them with essential life skills. Join us on this educational adventure and discover the world of emotions through the eyes of Emma.

										<li>The need to incorporate OpenCV for image processing presented a unique challenge, as the library was predominantly designed for C++ and Python environments.</li>
										<li>To integrate OpenCV into our C#-based game, I crafted a comprehensive suite of computer vision functions within a controlled C++ environment.</li>
										<li>Thorough testing ensured the reliability and functionality of these functions before they were separated into a distinct project that included only the specific OpenCV packages required for face detection and facial expression analysis. Extraneous packages were excluded, optimizing resource usage.</li>
